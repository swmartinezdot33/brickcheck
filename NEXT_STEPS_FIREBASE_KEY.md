# Next Steps: Using Your Firebase Service Account Key

Great! You've created the service account key. Now we need to:

1. **Find the key file** - Where did you download/save it?
   - Common locations: Downloads folder, Desktop
   - File name: Usually something like `brickcheck-86fcb-xxxxx.json` or `firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx.json`

2. **Convert to base64** - We'll convert it for the environment variable

3. **Add to Vercel** - Add it as `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`

Let me know where the file is, or if you'd like me to help you download it again using gcloud CLI!
